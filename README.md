# Earth Day Project 2025

Note: This will likey be renamed.

This Earth Day I'm looking at my garden and thinking I'd best get the most use out of it.

What do I want to know?

* Plants I'd like to plant
* Plants that are going to help with pests
* When to plant plants
* Whether plants are direct sown or transplanted from seedling
* Whether the plants were successful in previous years

So let's start with CRUD for plants.

# Running

Run using `python -m flask --app garden_flask run` or `flask --app garden_flask run`
During development append `--debug` to auto-reload after changing files.
